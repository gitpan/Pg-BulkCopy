Pg-BulkCopy

Pg:BulkCopy provides the missing Bulk Load utility for Postgres. It can be accessed in either of two manners -- through the included pg_bulkcopy.pl script, or by use of the Pg::BulkCopy Module, which provides the methods used in pg_bulkcopy.pl. 

Why would you choose this script over the other one? Primarily because this one is designed to just work. The python script and its' perl clone offer more in the way of advanced featers, but they don't just install and go. 


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	
TESTING

This module can only be tested when run from a postgres server with access to a database, therefore the tests in t run at install time are minimal. To properly test this bundle you must create a database and manually run the tests in the t2 directory.
